* [C|C#|javascript|golang). Or any other programming language that uses curly braces.
* Swap [] and {} so that curly braces don't require pressing the shift key.
* I set {speed4} for these macros to ensure it works with microsoft remote desktop sessions.

* Colemak
* I had RSI very badly in 2012 when I purchased a Kinesis Advantage and learned Colemak.
* Colemak *greatly* reduces the distance your fingers travel.
* An unbelievable number of words can be typed on the home row.
* I chose it over Dvorak for practical reasons.
* Colemak keeps your ctrl-c/ctrl-v/ctrl-x and punctuation keys in the same (qwerty) location making temporary use of a QWERTY keyboard relatively easy. 
* Dvorak makes typing `ls` is awkward.
* Colemak makes typing `ls` easy.
*
* If you're desperate enough to learn Colemak and already own a Kinesis Advantage, make sure you try out a vertical mouse too!
* The vertical mouse helped me the most, followed by the Kinesis Advantage, followed by Colemak.
