# Personal Layouts
Make a backup of your layout, and help other people learn tips and tricks from your customizations at the same time!

We're accepting your personal kinesis advantage layouts in this folder.
Please place your files in a folder that match your github user name.
For example, I'm "farmergreg" so my files are in the farmergreg folder.

Please take time to make comments in your file to help others understand why you've made the changes you have.
Please also make sure to remove any macros that shouldn't be public.
