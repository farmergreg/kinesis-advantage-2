* The QWERTY layout was designed in the 19th century. Colemak is a modern alternative to the QWERTY and Dvorak layouts.
* It is designed for efficient and ergonomic touch typing in English. Learning Colemak is a one-time investment that
* will allow you to enjoy faster and pain-free typing for the rest of your life. Colemak is now the 3rd most popular
* keyboard layout for touch typing in English, after QWERTY and Dvorak.

*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* INSTALLATION:
* 1 ) Switch to QWERTY mode: progm+F3
* 2 ) Create new layout file c_qwerty.txt: progm+F2 c
* 3a) Switch to MAC mode: progm+F5
* 3b) Switch to WIN mode: progm+F6
* 4 ) Mount the 'KINESIS KB' Drive: progm+F1
* 5 ) Copy c_qwerty.txt to the active folder. This will overwrite the file that is already there.
*
* NOTE: Step 3a / 3b work around a firmware bug in the keyboard. The workaround is simply that you need to switch
* between thumb key modes. If you have a Mac, then perform step 3b before 3a.
*

*
* NOTE: Many users do not map caps lock to backspace because the backspace key is already in a great position
*       on the Kinesis Advantage 2 keyboard. In particular, many Vim users remap caps lock to ESC and leave
*       backspace in the default location. 
* In this example: caps is remapped to escape unless it is held for more than 500ms:
* [caps]>[escape][t&h500][caps]
* in this example: caps simply becomes backspace:
*[caps]>[bspace]
