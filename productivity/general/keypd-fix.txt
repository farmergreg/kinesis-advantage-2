* ===== Keypad Number Fix  =====
* Some websites and software have a bug that makes them only work
* with the number keys on the top row of a keyboard. This problem 
* will happen with any keyboard; not just your Kinesis Advantage.
*
* The keypad number keys have different scan codes than the
* top row. The remappings below "fix" this problem by making all
* number keys act as though they are top row number keys.
